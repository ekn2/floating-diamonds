# Floating Diamonds

Floating Diamonds is a Game that I developed for a University programming class. It was a requirement to develop it using
Javascript and the [p5js animation library](https://p5js.org/).

## How to Play

Download the source code and open the index.html file in a web browser (preferably Chrome). You will see the character and the scenery right away.

### Goal

Collect as many diamonds as you can and reach the flag pole. The game keeps score of how many diamonds you've collected
and it will notify you when you've reached the end of the game.

### Rules
- There's only one level.
- The character can move forward and backwards, and it can jump.
- The character can pose on the brown platforms.
- The character will die if it falls down a canyon (open spaces).
- You have three lives.
- All diamonds can be collected.
- The character can jump to the other side of every canyon.
- It's possible to reach the flag pole.

### How to control the character
Move Forward - Right Arrow  
Move Backwards - Left Arrow  
Jump - Space
